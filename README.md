## Support
Building EOS Desktop takes a lot of hard work and time. If you want to support 
to the development of EOS Desktop you can send EOS to account name: `eosdesktopio`.

It does not perform any EOS network operations on your accounts.

Clone the Repository and run `npm install` and `npm run electron-build` to start the application. Maximize window for best user experience. 

## General Safety
Never put your private keys into EOS Desktop, the browser search bar, 
or any site that you navigate to. Use Scatter Desktop to manage access to your account keys/permissions.
